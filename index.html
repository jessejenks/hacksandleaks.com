                    <p>"As a journalist who has been working with data breaches for close to
                        ten years, actually getting to grips with that data is often the
                        hardest part of any reporting project. Lee's clear and concise book
                        will be an invaluable resource for reporters or researchers just
                        dipping into this sort of data, or those looking for new techniques. I
                        will certainly be using some of the tools myself. Hacked and dumped
                        datasets are rich sources of information that is the public interest,
                        and Lee's book will only increase the number of important stories
                        others are able to extract from them."</p>

                        practitioners to data science in a meaningful way, but also helps us
                        understand why we do the work we do."</p>
