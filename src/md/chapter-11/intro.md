On the morning of January 6, 2021, two months after Donald Trump lost
the 2020 election to Joe Biden by about 6 million votes, thousands of
Trump's supporters prepared to storm the US Capitol in Washington, DC,
hoping to subvert democracy. "We will never give up. We will never
concede," Trump told the crowd from the National Mall, just south of the
White House. "We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell,
you're not going to have a country anymore."
