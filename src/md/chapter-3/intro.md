If you're like most people, you interface with your computer primarily
via its graphical desktop environment: you move the pointer with your
mouse or trackpad and click icons to run programs and open documents.
Programs open in windows that you can resize, maximize, minimize, and
drag around the screen. You can run various programs at once in separate
windows and switch between them. However, there's an alternative,
incredibly powerful interface you can use to communicate with your
computer and give it instructions: the *command line interface (CLI)*.
