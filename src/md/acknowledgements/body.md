I'd like to express my sincere thanks to the following people:

To Abigail Schott-Rosenfield, my editor at No Starch Press, who did an
amazing job helping me revise each chapter and encouraging me to slow
down when I would have otherwise lost readers with too much technical
detail too quickly. Did you know that it takes a lot of work to write a
book? I'd also like to thank everyone else at No Starch Press who helped
make this book a reality.

To Jen Helsby, my amazingly talented technical reviewer, who
double-checked all of my work and suggested many improvements. Thanks to
Jen (who also happens to be my Dungeon Master!), I feel incredibly
confident in the technical accuracy of this book.

To my Signal group of beta readers, who gave me excellent early
feedback: Akil Harris, Kushal Das, Mara Hvistendahl, and Yael Grauer.
I'd also like to thank the Aleph developers and the fine journalists at
Unicorn Riot for giving feedback on specific chapters.

To my wife, Crystal, for supporting me throughout writing this book,
even though it cost us quite a few nights and weekends. Thank you also
for encouraging me to publish it under a Creative Commons license in
order to remove barriers to access for everyone who needs the skills it
teaches, no matter their income or what country they live in.
