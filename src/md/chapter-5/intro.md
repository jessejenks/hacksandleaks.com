When I get my hands on a new dataset, the first thing I do is search it
for any juicy, easy-to-find revelations. Depending on the dataset, I
might look for politicians, organizations, or the city where I live. In
the previous chapter, you learned to search text files like CSV or JSON
files using `grep`, but
`grep` won't work on binary
files like PDFs or Office documents. In this chapter, you'll expand your
search capabilities with Aleph, an open source investigation tool.
