Unlike any other point in history, hackers, whistleblowers, and
archivists now routinely make off with terabytes of data from
governments, corporations, and extremist groups. These datasets often
contain gold mines of revelations in the public interest, and in many
cases are freely available for anyone to download. Yet these digital
tomes can prove extremely difficult to analyze or interpret, and few
people today have the skills to do so.
