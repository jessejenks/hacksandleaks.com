Sometimes, in order to research important data publicly available
online, you'll need to download a local copy. When websites don't
provide this data in structured downloadable formats like spreadsheets,
JSON files, or databases, you can make your own copy using *web
scraping* (or *screen scraping*): writing code that loads web pages for
you and extracts their contents. These might include social media posts,
court documents, or any other online data. You can use web scraping to
download either full datasets or the same web page again and again on a
regular basis to see if its content changes over time.
