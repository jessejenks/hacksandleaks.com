It's hard for me to imagine doing the kind of data analysis work I do
without Linux. However, many Linux tools that I rely on every day simply
don't exist in the Windows ecosystem. Using just Windows, you can't make
your datasets searchable using Aleph, for example, or quickly spin up
popular SQL servers to import leaked databases. Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL) allows you to do these tasks and considerably more,
including running command line tools, in Windows without needing to set
up your own Linux VM.
