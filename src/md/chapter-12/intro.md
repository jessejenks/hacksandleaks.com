On a Saturday morning in late October 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
Robert Bowers posted a message to the fascist-friendly social network
Gab. "Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society likes to bring invaders in that
kill our people," he wrote. "I can't sit by and watch my people get
slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in." He was parroting the
"great replacement" conspiracy theory, popularized in the US by former
Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which claims that Jews are replacing white
people with immigrants of color.
