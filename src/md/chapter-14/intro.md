In early August 2017, hundreds of white supremacists assembled in the
city of Charlottesville, Virginia, for the Unite the Right rally. The
protesters---hailing from groups like Vanguard America, Identity Evropa,
League of the South, and the Ku Klux Klan---flew Nazi and Confederate
battle flags, wore red "Make America Great Again" hats, and chanted
slogans like "Jews will not replace us!"
