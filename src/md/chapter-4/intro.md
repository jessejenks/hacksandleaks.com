In this chapter, you'll build on the command line skills you've learned
so far and begin investigating real datasets. You'll use `for` loops to unzip the BlueLeaks files,
then search the files to determine which fusion centers have the most
data and which documents contain the keywords *antifa* and *Black Lives
Matter*. I'll also give an overview of the mysterious encrypted data in
the dataset and describe my hypothesis of how the hacker collected the
data.
