In some ways, I spent the summer of 2020 like many other Americans. I
mostly stayed at home, avoiding COVID-19 like the plague it is; I spent
far too many hours doom-scrolling through social media feeds; and
occasionally I put on an N95 mask, grabbed some hand sanitizer, and hit
the streets to protest the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna
Taylor, and countless other Black Americans. But I also spent much of
that summer writing code that would make it easier for me and other
journalists at The Intercept to make sense of the sprawling BlueLeaks
dataset.
