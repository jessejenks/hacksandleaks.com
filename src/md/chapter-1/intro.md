Most of us aren't very aware of it, but we're all under surveillance.
Telecom companies and tech giants have access to a massive amount of
private data about everyone who uses phones and the internet, from our
exact physical locations at any given time to the content of our text
messages and email, and they can share this data with leak
investigators.
