The skills you've learned in the last few chapters are instrumental for
investigating leaked datasets, but having basic programming knowledge is
even more powerful. Using Python or other programming languages, you can
give your computer precise instructions for performing tasks that
existing tools or shell scripts don't allow. For example, you could
write a Python script that scours a million pieces of video metadata to
determine where the videos were filmed. In my experience, Python is also
simpler, easier to understand, and less error-prone than shell scripts.
