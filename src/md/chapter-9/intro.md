The BlueLeaks dataset is full of an overwhelming number of documents,
but it's not immediately obvious where to start or how to make sense of
the data they contain. Before beginning an investigation, I needed a way
to efficiently determine the significance of these documents. After
manually digging through many files, I discovered that the context I
needed was in the hundreds of CSV spreadsheets in each BlueLeaks folder.
In this chapter, you'll learn how to investigate CSV files like these
yourself.
